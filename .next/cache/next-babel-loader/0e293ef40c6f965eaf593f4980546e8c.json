',\n          a: 'It takes a long time to find workers and it isn’t safe either. There are people that don’t keep their word and disappear, leaving you with a lack of workforce. Sometimes they come to our lands and ask for greater pay. Things usually don’t go the way you plan.'\n        }, {\n          q: 'Would you use a platform where people can list their services (e.g.: expertise in operating a certain machine, or repair of utilities) and the pay they expect per day?

The company must pay in advance when applying for the workers’ services and the rest afterwards.
