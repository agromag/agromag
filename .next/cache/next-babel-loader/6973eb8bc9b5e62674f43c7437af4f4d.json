',\n        a: 'It takes a long time to find workers and it isn’t safe either. There are people that don’t keep their word and disappear, leaving you with a lack of workforce. Sometimes they come to our lands and ask for greater pay. Things usually don’t go the way you plan.'\n      }, {\n        q: 'Would you use a platform where people can list their services (e.g.: expertise in operating a certain machine, or repair of utilities) and the pay they expect per day?

So, you could find farmers that need more machinery to harvest their land and you could be the one to provide it.
