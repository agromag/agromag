The questions that were asked in the form can be seen below: \",other:[{title:\"Interview #1: \",items:[{q:\"What would you say is the biggest shortcoming in today\\u2019s agricultural scene? \",a:\"The lack of workforce. It\\u2019s very hard to find people that are able to use machinery, plow or harvest the land.\"},{q:\"How do you usually obtain people for these things? \",a:\"I ask other farmers to recommend people they worked with in the past or through people\\u2019s mouth - I tell acquaintances that I need people to work with and the word goes through the village.\"},{q:\"What problems did you encounter using these methods? \",a:\"It takes a long time to find workers and it isn\\u2019t safe either. There are people that don\\u2019t keep their word and disappear, leaving you with a lack of workforce. Sometimes they come to our lands and ask for greater pay. Things usually don\\u2019t go the way you plan.\"},{q:\"Would you use a platform where people can list their services (e.g.: expertise in operating a certain machine, or repair of utilities) and the pay they expect per day? \",a:\"It sounds interesting, but how would you solve the security aspect? \"},{q:\"The platform will act as a third-party that will guarantee both sides that the deal will take place as it should. The company must pay in advance when applying for the workers\\u2019 services and the rest afterwards. If the worker won\\u2019t keep their part of the deal, they won\\u2019t receive the advance payment and they will be banned for a period. Also, we plan on having a review system, so people can compare prices and previous experiences, thus encouraging competition and professionalism in this field. \",a:\"This sounds great! There may be a couple of instances where people don\\u2019t keep their part of the deal at the start, but as the companies and people gather more reviews and experience the drawbacks of dishonesty, things will calm down and the market will develop. \"}]},{title:\"Interview #2: \",items:[{q:\"What is a problem you keep facing as a farmer? \",a:\"Scams. Scams that involve a very large amount of money. Even businesses that sell fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides do these kinds of things. You agree on an amount and a price, and they usually deliver significantly less products than discussed. \"},{q:\"How do you deal with this problem? \",a:\"There isn\\u2019t a sure way. I talk to people and see what they used in the past, but this approach doesn\\u2019t always work.\"},{q:\"How would you feel about a platform that would not only be a buffer between you and the company you buy from, making sure both parties keep their end of the bargain, but also provide you with a plethora of options regarding each aspect you\\u2019re interested in, allowing you to compare offers and see the reviews of each individual company? \",a:\"This seems like it could solve the problem I\\u2019m facing at the moment, but it\\u2019s only a small part of a bigger picture. Agriculture involves a lot of processes, like buying machinery, buying or renting land, workforce, buying seeds, crops solutions, repairing and maintaining utilities and so on. I think that your platform can also cover these areas. \"},{q:\"I agree. There is no reason why we shouldn\\u2019t expand our offer to all kinds of services inside this segment. Do you ever find yourself with machinery that sits still after working the land? \",a:\"Yes, there is a period of time when you don\\u2019t need to use them while the crops are growing and you\\u2019re waiting for the harvest.

So, you could find farmers that need more machinery to harvest their land and you could be the one to provide it. On the other hand, you could rent more land from people who don\\u2019t want to work theirs and use your machinery on it. Of course, these are just some examples of the multiple possible use cases, all including the same principles of business safety. \",a:\"To be honest, if such a service existed, I would use it.
